### Mother Moon

Mother Moon is the minor deity that the Werewolves of Honshinu worship. They credit her with two things:
- Allowing them the ability to surface out of the mindless, instinctual rage and hunger that plagues others with lycanthropy.
- Allows them to live within the Blackwoods peacefully.
### Appearance:
- Some of the ways she appears are: 
	- With the body of a human and the head of a wolf.
	- As a person with a mane of hair, yellow eyes and paws for hands/feet
	- She always looks part human, part wolf; she cannot hide her nature, nor does she want to.
- She's often flanked by wolves made of darkness and/or stars.
	- This is why the werewolves like Kai so much!

She communicates with her followers through omens found during the night.
- Astrology is a revered custom by Mother Moon followers
- Shooting stars are believed to be her wolves, and are interpreted as omens by her followers.

She was once mortal, and raised to divinity.
- Her nature can actually be passed on to a worthy successor, allowing the current Moon Mother to return to earth and experience a peaceful death.
- There have been three Mother Moons; their earthly names are expunged from records when they ascend to divinity.
