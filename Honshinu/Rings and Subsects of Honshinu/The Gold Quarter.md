(Merchant's Quarter)

Named simply for the quality of coin that passes through this area, the Gold Quarter is the sector that hosts the most outright trade. Butterfly Square is the beating heart of the sector, as horses and carts are allowed to move freely in and out (and trade can happen out of the cart, creating an ever-changing sea of people, places and objects.
