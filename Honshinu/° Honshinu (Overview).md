## Origins:
The town was first founded some 4000 years ago; while its grown and shrunk over the years, it's always existed in some form as a port of call for those that want to travel through the Blackwoods. It also serves as the last port of call for the Royal Crown - their rulership ends on the western edge of the Blackwoods. 

The city is split into four sections:
- The Outskirts
- The Outer Circle
- The Inner Circle 
- The Core
- The Roots

## The Outskirts

**The Outskirts** is everything between the forest and the city walls; mostly when people refer to this it's the farmlands that feed the city they're primarily talking about. Anything grown in the soil grows to much larger that its expected size - for some things this is ideal, for others less so.
- Farmland takes up most of this area.
- Viticus shrine 
	- Looks after patrons of the city who do not want to be cremated.
	- Run by an old retired adventurer, who is living out his last years tending to his beloved's grave.
- Greenwalkers
	- The Druid/Ranger Guild
		- Focused primarily on the balance between civilization and the wilds.
- The Stables
	- Potbelly man with a kind face runs it
	- Has offered to take pepper in.

## The Outer Ring

**The Outer Circle** refers to anything within the first ring of walls within the city - it is open passage for all folk through these doors, though the main gates are typically closed at night and single person side entrances used for passage and patrols. 
It doesn't care about those going into the Inner Circles; many people will come down to the Outer Circle to drink or work, and go home.

## The Inner Circle

**The Inner Circle** is less rough than the outside; those in this area live a comfortable life. Carts are on restricted access into this area, and the city's more upmarket offerings exist around here. The city's magic offerings also collect at this level.

## The Core

**The Core** is where official business happens, and the highest echelons of society live. Entry into this area is restricted at night, but free during the day - to the government section, anyway. Straying too far into the "nicer" parts may find ruffians turns away... Sometimes by force.
- The City Hall is where people can come to submit legislation to be reviewed and seek legal help.
	- A permanent summoning circle exists here.
