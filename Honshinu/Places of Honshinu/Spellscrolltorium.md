title: The Spellscrolltorium
---
- Is down an alleyway off an alleyway - the sort of place you only go to if you look.
- Entry room is a 15x15 foot square, with a large desk that nevermore perches on to check people as they come in.
- Can only browse if you offer a scroll.
	- Nevermore the crow will check these.
- Has odd and unique spells.
- Thin 15ft across room with large sweeping library laders

- Run by a wizard, Rutherford, all dressed in black and his crow, Nevermore
- Rutherford is sweet on Ke'nan.
	- Is not a necromancer, but is fascinated by it.
