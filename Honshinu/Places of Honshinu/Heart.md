The Goverment building
- Three two coats of arms on the oustide, two large and one small
- One is the Cassalanter Crown
- The Other is the Honshinu Watch - a pawprint with a sword and shield
- The smaller one is a shield with a line of trees, with scales, a mace and a moon
- There's also the dragonborn clans (a scale in every colour)
- And the Aquatan settlement (a clamshell with a pearl, a trident and a hippocampus)

(Explain that there's the Honshinu Watch, the historical guard group of this place, the CityMalitia, the commonfolk police essentially, and the Royal Crown and its associates which have a place here from being part of the Cassalanter's Kingdom)

A human called Thassa will greet them, and not look suprised at his name. Say that Ryia has only just gotten in but can see them now.
