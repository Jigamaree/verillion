title: The Snake Bite
---

Garbed in Aztec-like designs, the place is a roaring hub for adventurers. A noticeboard asks for the help of adventurers both green and old hat, the barkeep keeps the drink flowing, and folk socialize in hopes of finding companions to tackle the depths of the forest together... And hopefully not be abandoned at the sign of first loot.
