Fangdor Keep stands as a monument of the shame and villainy of the Vaalhurst family.

Recognizing a time of both unprecedented danger for the Blackwoods, as well as an opportunity to truly make their mark upon the land, [[Clarence 'Amo' Valhurst]] was the one to suggest initially the construction of Fangdor Keep - an idea [[Baron William Vaalhurst]] took to readily.

Fangdor Keep was conceived with two functions.
Firstly, it was to act as a bastion against all threats to Vaalhurst's reign. This was the main reason preached to Honshinu citizens, along with a promise that the walls would guard them as much as their beloved baron.
The second purpose was to serve as a base of operations for Baron Vaalhurst's research into prolonged life; William had become increasingly disillusioned about his human lifespan as he aged, and the keep would be able to serve as a unassuming operation towards researching this end.

While Baron Vaalhurst is now - justly - remembered for his autarchic rule, at the time of Fangdor Keep's inception he was well regarded. This respect carried him through many of the controversies that plagued the early years of construction. The assassinations of the keep's architects was able to be successfully played off as a series of unfortunate accidents, while the poor working conditions were justified by the war's affect on supply chains. 

However, the good will was tainted irrevocably when Baron Vaalhurst laid off the majority of the workforce from the city, opting for mage driven construction to speed up turnaround. This was heavily discouraged by Amo, knowing this would disrupt his plan to take the Baron's title for himself - however, William's desires had been irrevocably warped by psychosis. 
A want for solitude became a disgust for the common folk, a desire to rule over the Blackwoods became a hunger to expand his reach - and a desire for a prolonged lifespan had festered into a thirst for immortality, at any cost.

Additional defenses were laid into the keep as a result of this spiraling paranoia. Plans for a single secret entrance into the keep through the bath house warped into a dizzying maze of secret rooms, passages, and pass-keyed doors. Shifting traps, able to be moved by the Baron's will, were installed by the Terrance Whiskerfire, the Baron's wizard. The baron's desire for an unquestioning army even lead the wizard to necromantic paths.
The most damning defense put in place, however, was the arcane barrier against the Honshinu City Watch, which completely barred them from setting foot onto the land.

The true turning point for Keep, however, was the completion of the keep. When construction finished, the mages employed never returned - killed by the mad baron who feverishly wanted no living man to know the secrets of the keep. The lack of answers and censorship of information on the missing people, the iron fisted rule enforced by the Baron onto the Blackwoods, and the inability for the City Watch to step foot onto the land all fed into the [[Storming of Fangdor Keep]] - an event that saw the Keep besieged, its inhabitants liberated, and the architects of the wretched place killed for good.

...At least, that is what is widely believed. During the storming, the Baron attempted to enact the ritual he believed through years of research would give him the immortality he sought. The magic was incorrect - but instead of killing him, it transformed him into a wretched inhuman creature caught between life and death, desperately clinging onto the same ambitions he was warped by in life.

While time attempts to reclaim the keep, the hatred of the Baron
