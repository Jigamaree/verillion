Lycanthropy, in most situations, is believed to be a curse that dooms those infected to become little more than rampaging monsters. This is not quite the case in the Blackwoods - while they acknowledge that the magic on them *is* a curse, the people inflicted with it have a long history of being protectors and wardens of the Blackwoods.

There are two main packs in the Blackwoods:
- The City Watch
	- People don't suspect what's right in front of their nose
	- The most obvious of the two, and operate within the guard system
- The Dark Hands
	- A pack that operates in the shadow of what is legal - though never against the code of the packs.
	- The less obvious of the two
- Other packs exist, but pledge alliance to one of these two governing bodies, or face potentially being chased off the land.
	- Some pledge themselves to [[Mother Moon]] instead of a pack; these are people who embrace living as a wolf instead of their human lives. There's a pity, but an understanding to this.

The Blackwoods Code:
- Protect those who cannot protect themselves
- Let your instincts guide you, and your humanity temper you
- Our power is in our secrecy.

Becoming one:
- *Always* involves a bite that draws blood.
- Must be done by either a Forsaken or Embraced(+) werewolf
### Mechanical/Physical:
Baseline:
- In addition to your current creature type, you count as a *monstrosity* for the purposes of any spells or abilities that value this. 
- You gain vulnerability to silvered weapons.
- if you are subjected to the light of a full moon you must succeed at a DC 20 Wisdom or automatically turn into your hybrid form and cannot transform back until dawn. (Cooldown 24 hours.)

- Stage 0: Forsaken
	- This stage happens one of a few ways knowingly:
		- When somebody is unknowingly turned, and are overwhelmed by the suffering of being alone and a monster
		- When somebody is overwhelmed by the needs and urges of their wolf form in a way they cannot recover from.
		- When a person actively forsake the teaching of Mother Moon and the packs - glutting themselves on violence and bloodshed
			- A third, secret way: the process that the Ashen Propherts/The Cult uses to turn people into draconic abominations will react with the lycanthropy, and potentially force them into Forsaken.
	- This does not happen accidently. *Multiple* things need to go wrong, including pack leaders failing to step in.
	- To be forsaken is to let the force of the curse rip through the person's humanity, tearing anything left of it to shreds. The creature that remains is nothing but a beast of instinct, hunger and rage.
	- Can tell by the form - a twisted, hulking hybrid form - and the eyes - no whites or iris, only pupil.
	- Only a *wish* can save them once they get to this point, as the person they were has been destroyed entirely.

- Stage 1: Wildling ("Pup")
	- The call of the wild is all encompassing; even those who are prepared for it can spend a long time in this stage.
	- Can be 'cured' by Remove Curse
	- Gain access to the hybrid transformation - a monstrous being half beast, half sentient. This follows the Grim Hollow werewolf rules, with the following changes:
		- Any heavy armour, armour made of metal, and shields not held worn are immediately dropped to the ground.
		- You cannot end your transformation willingly.
	- Cannot resist turning into a werewolf (DC 20 Wisdom) (- Grim Hollow's *Predatory Nature* affects you.)
		- when exposed to blood.
		- exposed to prey/helpless creatures
		- involved in a chase
	- Grim Hollow's *Lust for the Hunt* affects you in hybrid form, with the following changes:
		- "closest nonplayer creature you can see, smell or hear" => closest non-werewolf
	- Initiates are not permitted to go out in public, or leave the Blackwoods.
	
- Stage 2: Awakened
	- You hear the call of the wild; it is like music, and now you know the tune.
	- Can be 'cured' by Greater Restoration
	- Gain access to kindred form; indistinguishable from a regular wolf, and an icon of the Blackwoods.
	- You can end your transformation willingly.
	- *Predatory Nature* is reduced from DC 10 to DC 5, and is done at advantage if the target would be a party member.
	- *Lust for the Hunt* is reduced from DC 10 to DC 5, and is done at advantage if the target would be a party member.
	- Choose from Iron Pelt/Hunter's Howl
	
- Stage 3: Embraced
	- The call of the wild hums through you, and you call to it in turn.
	- Can only be 'cured' by a wish.
	- You can speak while transformed. (Verbally for hybrid, mentally for kindred?)
	- *Lust for the Hunt* no longer affects you.
	- *Predatory Nature* is reduced from DC 10 to DC 5
	- Choose from Titanic Vigor/Predatory Leap/Bestial Savagery, or a previous boon.

- Stage 4: Venerated
	- You have heard the call of the wild and *answered* - this is a part of you, and you live in harmony with it.
	- Can only be 'cured' by a wish.
	-  *Predatory Nature* no longer affects you.
	- You gain *Kindred Affinity*.
	- Choose from Savage Insticts, Unstoppable Rage, or a previous boon.
