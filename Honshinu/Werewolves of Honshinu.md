This concerns the cultural side of werewolfism in the Blackwoods. For the mechanical side, see [[Lycanthropy in Honshinu]].

Lycanthropy, in most situations, is believed to be a curse that dooms those infected to become little more than rampaging monsters. This is not quite the case in the Blackwoods - while they acknowledge that the magic on them *is* a curse, the people inflicted with it have a long history of being protectors and wardens of the Blackwoods.

The main reason they are able to alleviate the curse is due to the figure known as [[Mother Moon]] - a figurehead and hero of the region venerated to immortality. So long as an initiate abides by the Prayer of Mother Moon (and for not-PCs, stay within the Blackwoods) they will keep their mind. Additionally, Mother Moon's influence affects long time residents, allowing them to dismiss strange wolf activity.

There are two main packs in the Blackwoods - a harkening to the light and dark sides of the moon:
- The City Watch
	- People don't suspect what's right in front of their nose
	- The most obvious of the two, and operate within the guard system
		- Notable figures:
			- [[Ryia Clawson]] - mayor of Honshinu
			- [[Evander Galanodel]] - the guy who hates Jayon, co-leader
			- [[Briar]] - cheeky, fiery redhead, pack member
			- [[Adderson Murphy]] - tattooist, pack member
			- Tiberius - dark haired mop, pack member
- The Dark Hands
	- A pack that operates in the shadow of what is legal - though never against the code of the packs.
	- The less obvious of the two.

Other splinter packs exist but pledge alliance to one of these two governing bodies, or face being chased off the land - a death sentence, as Mother Moon's influence ends at the edge of the Blackwoods.
	- Some pledge themselves to Mother Moon instead of a pack; these are people who embrace living as a wolf instead of their human lives. There's a pity, but an understanding to this.

**The Prayer of Mother Moon:**
- Protect those who cannot protect themselves
- Let your instincts guide you, and your humanity temper you
- Our power is in our secrecy.
