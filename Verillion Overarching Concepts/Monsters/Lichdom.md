There are many ways to become a lich, but one thing is for certain; the act of becoming a lich and sustaining such a form is an inherently evil act, requiring the constant sacrifice of innocent people to the cause of the caster.

The path to Lichdom requires two things:
- The creation of a phylactery. 
- The ritualistic death of the caster.
