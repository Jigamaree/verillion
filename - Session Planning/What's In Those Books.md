- "Ladylock's Fanciful Tales: A Collection of Honshinu's Folklore"
	- an adventurer said to wield a blade that hissed like the rivers and always smelled like salt, could summon the sword out of the moisture in the air... and many hints at the archivist, no wonder the archivist wants it gone 
	- two children who ran into the forest at night (following very specific instructions) that transported them into the feywild

	- Alyssa, of Blazing Glory: A elemental sorcerer who helped wit
	


- "The Duality of Divinity"

- "Where in the World is Vessa Oakheart?"
	- Details the people she kept in contact with; as an elf this was a lot!
		- Dalliance and Reece: helped them to take down Talahad's lich.
		- Dorgunn; said she and her had a romantic relationship that ended on good terms. The height difference was endearing.  ~~Tol and smoll continues~~
		- Atrem Boneshaker: bonded with him about being drawn to the gods you Really Wouldn't expect them to go to, but was always a bit tenacious
	- Detailed people that might not like her/she spurred
	- Say how she was spurred to returned to the Elvenlands on the call of her god; that all who encountered her said she repeated the same thing.
		- *I need to go home. The elves are about to make a terrible mistake - and if I can get there fast enough, maybe I can stop them.*
	- Dorgunn attempted to stop her, and was killed for her efforts - despite the close relationship they'd had until this point. 
	- The war ended not long after; it's speculated that she did make it home. 
		- She's not dead; nobody can find her in the hall of souls, attempts to resurect her failed.
		- ...But if she's alive, she's unobservable. Scrying fails, attempts to use *Message* failed. Additionally, she would be alive *well* outside her lifespan.
