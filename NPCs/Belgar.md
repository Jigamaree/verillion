Zargon Belgar Smokewhisper (37, Bronze Dragonborn, Male)

- Soulguide - "not much of a guide though"

- Suffering from magic fray; wears magic cuffs that can bind him to the ground with a key word (DOWN in draconic)

- Enjoys hunting undead more than anything else, doesn't need to worry about slipping that way
- Likes Quesadillas

- Parents are dead
- Grew up in Western Verillion; travelled to the Blackwoods for a time before going onto Liberatham
	- Thats where he met his mentor for [[Soulguides|The Soulguides]]
- Liberatham is where he had his first true Magic Fray attack
	- Was hunting an owlbear that'd charged into the city - the fight took him into the side of a small school.
	-  Killed 10 children, two teachers before he came to.
		- Remembers every face
	- Alone in a room, with dead people and blood on his hands.
	- **Still has a warrant for arrest in Liberatham.**
- Made his way to Dylvath, where he can continue his soulguide work without putting people in danger
	- He doesn't *want* to die
		- But he also knows that what he did was unforgivable.
		- He also knows that even if he takes the amulet he's already capable of violence.
